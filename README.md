Front-end for a personal project that I'll use to save notes, vocabulary and help me study Japanese overall.
The API I'm using is also mine, here's the repo: https://github.com/Dioonel/Japanese-Backend

**Important note:**
Right now this app is only for my **personal use**, the words and kanjis are public, but POST, PUT and DELETE operations require an **admin access**. In the future, I might expand this app with a complete user system to make it usable for anyone else.


**ToDo:** 
- ~~Pagination via infinite scroll (this will requiere a back-end update also).~~
- Add categories to both kanjis and words.
- Add functionalities or "small games" to excercise the saved kanjis and words (similar to Anki). 🚧 **Currently WIP** 🛠️
- Improve styling. 🚧 **Currently WIP** 🛠️
- User system.
- Create unit tests for the whole app. 🚧 **Currently WIP** 🛠️
